# Dev Portfolio

This repo contains an personal dev portfolio that was created with Sass and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. The site is static. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content. Forked from: https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio
